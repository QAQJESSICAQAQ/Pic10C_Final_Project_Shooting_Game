# Pic10C_Final_Project_Shooting_Game
Original purpose: implementing a oreo game using qt

[Oreoo repository (failed)](https://github.com/QAQJESSICAQAQ/Pic10C_Final-Project/edit/master/README.md) 

NOW CHANGES DUE TO LACK OF SKILLS---IMPLEMENTING A PLANE SHOOTING GAME

## Getting Started

Watching qt tutorials (knowledge needed to implement the game)

* Openning new windows

* QPix



DAY 1

* QGraphicsScene -- container of all of my game objects, like a map. 

* QGraphicsItem (QGraphicsRecItem)-- objects in QGraphicsItem and its subclasses goes inside the scene.

* QGraphicsView --the widget that visualize the scene.



DAY 2 ---creating a rectangle that moves corresponding to the up/down/left/right key

* Events -- KeyPressEven() and QKeyEvent

* Event Propagation System --the order in which the event is passed around

* Header file QDebug


DAY 3 ---creating a bullet class (retangle will shoot when the space is pressed)

* QTimer

* Signals and Slots (learned in lecture)

* QObject and Q_OBJECT macro




## Acknowledgments

After realizing the oreo app needs qt 3D creator I decided to switch to a simpler game, which only involves the regular qt creator (by follwing a qt game tutorial).
