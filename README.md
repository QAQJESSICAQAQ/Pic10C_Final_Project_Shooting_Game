# Pic10C_Final_Project_Shooting_Game
Original purpose: implementing a oreo game using qt

[Oreoo repository (failed)](https://github.com/QAQJESSICAQAQ/Pic10C_Final-Project/edit/master/README.md) 

NOW CHANGES DUE TO LACK OF SKILLS---IMPLEMENTING A PLANE SHOOTING GAME

## Getting Started
Watching qt tutorials (knowledge needed to implement the game)
* Openning new windows
* QPix
* QGraphicsScene -- container of all of my game objects, like a map. 
* QGraphicsItem (QGraphicsRecItem)-- objects in QGraphicsItem and its subclasses goes inside the scene.
* QGraphicsView --the widget that visualize the scene.


## Acknowledgments
After realizing the oreo app needs qt 3D creator I decided to switch to a simpler game, which only involves the regular qt creator (by follwing a qt game tutorial).
